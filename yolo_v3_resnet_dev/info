Data Loading:
- Using pytorch's dataloader, a batch of data should be loaded:
- Transform images into a format accepted by the NN. E.g. 416x416 using padding. (argumentations)
- Transform bbox labels into a formate which is the same as that of the transformed image (argumentations)
- Transform bbox labels into yolo labels -> S1: 13x13, S2: 26x26, S3: 52x52
- Question: Each scale's each cell has 3 bboxes. Is this needed in the yolo labels?
- Into which scale do I put a given bbox?

Data Loading Unit Test:
- Each helper function in the dataloader should be unit tested

Main Function:
